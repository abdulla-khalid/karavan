## Steps to run project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn` or `npm install`

This will add the dependencies required to run the project.

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

This will start the project.

Note: If npm gives your errors, run "sudo npm install --global yarn" (if you don't already have yarn) -> "yarn" -> "yarn start"
